    <h2>The first builds of the game (INCLUDING dev builds!)</h2>
    U.O.S.G. (Untitled OS Game) started (aka had its first build released) on August 11th of 2024 at 8 hours, six minutes and thirty-three seconds GMT+00:00. Two seconds later, there was a square white box on the screen. Two minutes later and the game already had the square rounded and a black outline around it. After 6 minutes since the first build the game had some random stuff drawn on the square. Version 7, drawn stuff removed, first original game title became "untitled GUI game." On version 9, the first original OS-like version of the game came onto the game version history list with some wallpaper I am not going to talk about. The first published game version - version 13 - was something from half a dozen versions earlier (the GUI game). In version 14 the GUI vanished altogether. Other GUI appeared in V15, but it is still not the OG actual OS game. The first app's first design appeared in version 17 (I assume it's the first version of UOSG, but I don't know myself). Next version (18) invented app rounded corners and a taskbar image. The next build changed that into a taskbar text button and added rounded TB corners. Version 20 added the menu (which was just a square, LOL) V22, actual menu, no app buttons, WCC hidden. Also first ever published UOSG that was an OS. V25 is finally a playable OS.. sort of... kind of... V26 had WCC scripts (finally), but it doesn't seem to be complete - the click function call has just "script.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent" - so it isn't so playable yet. V27 is playable (button does something). Jumping to next published - V33 - and the game is broken. Desktop app button does nothing, menu's app list is misplaced. V44 has login, but it contains just a ReadMe containing "to do later: make a login screen here". It has already a boot screen! No logo, no text, white bar (it's a 2-colored gradient in newest build, V719 at the time of writing this), but it works! V49 had app UIDrag, which allowed the user to move it by holding the window (includes app content dragging, which was never actually fixed and works to the newest version). V66 - added (scrapped since a few dozen builds later) Player List App.
