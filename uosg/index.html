    <h1>Untitled OS Game Official Status</h1>

      <li><i>fixed</i>: rebooting on mobile still causes the <code>firmware</code> GUI to appear (which requires keyboard to operate through)</li>

    <h2>The first builds of the game (INCLUDING dev builds!)</h2>
    U.O.S.G. (Untitled OS Game) started (aka had its first build released) on August 11th of 2024 at 8 hours, six minutes and thirty-three seconds GMT+00:00. Two seconds later, there was a square white box on the screen. Two minutes later and the game already had the square rounded and a black outline around it. After 6 minutes since the first build the game had some random stuff drawn on the square. Version 7, drawn stuff removed, first original game title became "untitled GUI game." On version 9, the first original OS-like version of the game came onto the game version history list with some wallpaper I am not going to talk about. The first published game version - version 13 - was something from half a dozen versions earlier (the GUI game). In version 14 the GUI vanished altogether. Other GUI appeared in V15, but it is still not the OG actual OS game.
